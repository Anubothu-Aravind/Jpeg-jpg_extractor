# JPEG File Extractor and Copier

## Description
This Python script extracts `.jpg` or `.jpeg` files from a specified directory that were modified within a specific date range and copies them into a new folder. The folder is named with the format `extraction_<timestamp>`, where `<timestamp>` is the current UNIX timestamp.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Modules used:
  - `os`
  - `time`
  - `datetime`
  - `shutil`

No external dependencies are required for this script.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download the repository**:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Modify the script**:
   
   - Set the `directory_path` to the path where your `.jpg` or `.jpeg` files are stored.
   - Specify the `start_date` and `end_date` in the `datetime` format to define the range of file modification dates.

3. **Run the script**:

   ```
   python extract_and_copy.py
   ```

   The script will extract all `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files that were modified within the specified date range and copy them to a new folder in the current working directory. The folder will be named `extraction_<timestamp>`.

### Example
If you want to extract files modified between October 1, 2024, and October 9, 2024, and your directory path is `C:\Users\91837\Downloads\Telegram Desktop`, you would set the following variables:

```python
directory_path = r'C:\Users\91837\Downloads\Telegram Desktop'
start_date = datetime(2024, 10, 1)
end_date = datetime(2024, 10, 9)
```

After running the script, the extracted `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files will be copied to a folder named something like `extraction_1696856242`.

## Functions

### `extract_jpeg_files(directory, start_time, end_time)`
This function extracts all `.jpg` or `.jpeg` files from the specified `directory` that were modified between `start_time` and `end_time`.

- **Parameters**:
  - `directory`: The path of the directory to search.
  - `start_time`: The starting datetime for filtering files.
  - `end_time`: The ending datetime for filtering files.

- **Returns**:
  - A list of file paths for `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files that match the time range.

### `copy_extracted_files(file_paths, output_directory)`
This function copies the extracted files into the `output_directory`. If the directory does not exist, it creates one.

- **Parameters**:
  - `file_paths`: A list of file paths to be copied.
  - `output_directory`: The directory where the files will be copied.

## Customization
- You can change the directory path and the date range by modifying the values of `directory_path`, `start_date`, and `end_date`.
- The new folder is created in the current working directory, but you can modify the script to save it elsewhere by changing the `output_directory` value in the script.
